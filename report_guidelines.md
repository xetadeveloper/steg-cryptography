# Performance Analysis Report Guidelines

## How to Use the Performance Analysis Tool

### 1. Running the Analysis
```bash
python performance_analysis.py
```

This will:
- Benchmark each cryptographic component individually
- Test with different message and image sizes
- Generate comprehensive performance metrics
- Save results in both JSON and Markdown formats

### 2. Understanding the Results

#### Key Metrics Measured:
- **Execution Time**: How long each operation takes
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption during operations
- **Statistical Analysis**: Average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation
- **Scalability**: Performance across different data sizes

#### Components Analyzed:
1. **AES-256 Encryption/Decryption**: Symmetric encryption performance
2. **RSA-2048 Operations**: Asymmetric key exchange performance
3. **HMAC-SHA256**: Message authentication performance
4. **Steganography**: Image processing and data hiding performance
5. **Full Pipeline**: End-to-end encryption/decryption performance
